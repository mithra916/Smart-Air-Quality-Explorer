# Smart-Air-Quality-Explorer

## About the Project
```
Smart Air Quality Explorer is a powerful Python-based system that focuses on transforming raw air quality datasets into meaningful insights. It helps in cleaning, storing, and optionally visualizing air pollution data using modern tools such as Pandas, MongoDB, and HTML dashboards.

This project can benefit researchers, students, data scientists, and policymakers aiming to understand and act on air quality trends.
```

## Purpose

```
This project is built with the vision of promoting environmental awareness and data-driven decisions.
From students to civic bodies, anyone can benefit from understanding how pollution trends evolve and take action
toward cleaner air.
```

## Key Highlights

## Data Cleaning & Processing
Cleanses and preprocesses messy air quality datasets for accurate analysis using pandas.

## MongoDB Integration
Supports importing cleaned data into a NoSQL MongoDB database for fast and flexible queries.

## Dashboard-Friendly Output
Exports results into an HTML page for basic display and sharing of insights.

## Modular Python Scripts
Each function is organized into its own file (ETL-style), improving maintainability.

## Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML

Backend: Python

Database: MongoDB

Libraries: pandas, pymongo

Tools: Git, VS Code


## How it works
```
ðŸ”¹ Raw Dataset (data_date.csv)
Contains air quality readings collected from open sources or sensors.

ðŸ”¹ Cleaning Script (clean.py)
Processes missing values, removes noise, and formats the data.

ðŸ”¹ MongoDB Handler (mongodb.py)
Connects to MongoDB and inserts the cleaned data into a specified collection.

ðŸ”¹ Output (cleaned_air_quality.csv)
Serves as the processed dataset for further analysis or storage.

ðŸ”¹ Optional Web Output (index.html)
Displays results through a basic webpage or can be extended into a dashboard.
```

## Future Enhancements
```
Real-time AQI tracking using live APIs

Chart integration using Plotly or Matplotlib

Geolocation-based air quality mapping

Machine Learning-based pollution forecasting

Integration with cloud dashboards (Streamlit/Power BI)
```
